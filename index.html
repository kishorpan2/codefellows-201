Eventhough I like where I am today I still miss the military life sometimes.

      <h2 id='me'>Summer</h2>
      <p class="about-me"> 
          I woke up with sunlight in my eyes</br>
          through the curtain fissure</br>
          warm light hit my deck </br>
          and the sand in the beach</br>
        </br>
      </br>
          I walked through the dunes to the beach </br>
          and the umbrella to beach </br>
          with dreams of my life</br>
          and sound of the ocean</br>
      </br>
      </br>
          On the lazy hazy days </br>
          In the melancholy beach, with the breeze in my face </br> 
          felt asleep in the dreams filled in the eyes</br>
          I release stress to the universe</br>
        </br>
        </br>
          Thats why I like summer, I wish summer came sooner</br>
          sooner than ever</br>
          with which comes </br>
          my hopes and dreams of my life</br>
        </br>
      </p>
